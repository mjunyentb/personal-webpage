As a computer scientist, I am interested in applying AI algorithms to solve sequential decision problems. This interest has grown over the years by developing algorithms for autonomous systems that have to interact with dynamic environments. During my Bachelor thesis, I worked on the autonomous flight of an unmanned aerial vehicle, where I developed a passion for robotics and control that led me to enroll in a MSc in that field. With a more specific interest in a machine learning and optimization approach to the control problem, I decided to pursue a PhD in deep reinforcement learning and AI symbolic planning at [AI & ML group](https://www.upf.edu/web/ai-ml/) of the [Pompeu Fabra University](https://www.upf.edu/home), supervised by [Anders Jonsson](https://www.upf.edu/web/anders-jonsson) and [Vicenç Gómez](https://www.upf.edu/web/vgomez/), which I recently completed.
